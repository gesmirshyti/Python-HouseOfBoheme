            <p>We create bespoke holistic events, tailored especially to your needs, including everything from the cozy sanctuary set up to a personalised timetable of classes and workshops hosted by our team of coaches and therapists. From yoga mats and meditation cushions to plants and lighting, we will provide the perfect surroundings to help you find some clarity, connection and calmness.</p>
            <p>We can also provide catering through our partner plant based kitchen, or perhaps some cocktails to celebrate at the end of a day of relaxation.</p>

    <h1>IN PERSON EVENTS</h1>
  <p>We have been running our ‘Pop Up Sanctuary’ events in London for the past two years, as a day or weekend retreat and an opportunity to escape the hectic city.</p>
  <p>We are currently busy planning our first post-COVID event – the perfect way to reconnect with others again and ease your way back into ‘normal life’.</p>
  <p>Check back soon for updates or sign up to our newsletter to be the first to hear!</p>
